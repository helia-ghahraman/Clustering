# A Brief Explanation
Here we are given a dataset consisting of different domains. For each image, a feature vector and its label is given. The label demonstrates the content of the image itself and not the cluster it belongs to, therefore we have no information about the domains label nor the number of them.
# Clustering
Firstly, we had to find the right clustering algorithm and check whether the algorithm we chose and the parameters we set are suitable for clustering our data or not. (This is basically evaluating what we have done so far.)
# Finding the number of domains
In addition, we needed to find the domains which was quit a complicated task and depended on our chosen algorithm. At the end we had to show the number of domains and what domain each cluster points at.
# Evaluation with cluster labels
When it comes to test, there are 2 files. The first,identified the clustersâ€™ labels for a small part of the training data (5 percent), and the second is the test data. Using these, we eventually evaluated our algorithm and the method we utilized.
